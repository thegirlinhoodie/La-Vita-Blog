        <li><h3 class="tag">What is La Vita Journal?</h3>
        <p>
             It's your new cozy internet nook — a life journal where stories bloom, feelings spill, and creativity roams free. From messy thoughts to poetic gold, it’s all welcome here.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag">Why the name “La Vita Journal”?</h3>
        <p>
            La Vita means “life” in Italian — and life is exactly what we’re documenting. The beautiful, bizarre, boring, brilliant bits of it. Plus, doesn’t it just roll off the tongue with a little espresso-flavored flair?
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag">What kind of stuff lives here?</h3>
        <p>
              Everything from personal essays, poetry, and art, to “shower thoughts at 2am.” If it’s honest, heartfelt, or hilariously human — it belongs here. Expect journal-style blogs, nostalgic rambles, and the occasional ode to coffee.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag">Who writes the blog posts?</h3>
        <p>
             You do. That’s the magic. This isn’t just one girl’s diary (though she’s definitely around, caffeinated and chaotic). It’s a community. Whether you’ve written ten novels or just had a lovely thought today — you can share it.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag">Can I submit my own blog?</h3>
        <p>
            Heck yes! If you’ve got something to say, say it here. You can write and upload your own posts right from the site. Pour your heart out, share your spark, or just rant about the weird dream you had. We love it all.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag">Do I need to be a “writer”?</h3>
        <p>
            Nope. You just need to be you. If it comes from the heart (or from a late-night impulse), it’s welcome. We’re all about the raw, the real, and the relatable.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag"> Is it moderated?</h3>
        <p>
             Lightly, yes. We’re all for creative freedom, but hate speech, spam, or meanness gets the boot. Kindness is the house rule.
        </p></li>

        <li><h3 class="tag">What’s the vibe here, really?</h3>
        <p>
            Think: a handwritten journal, a comfy chair, soft indie music, and a barista who’s lowkey judging your 5th coffee. It’s warm, slightly dramatic, very human, and always inviting.
