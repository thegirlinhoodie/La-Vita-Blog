<h1 class="head">Get In Touch With Me!</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m just a girl who runs on coffee, curiosity, and a little chaos — in the loveliest way, of course. A loyal friend to bookmarks and browser tabs alike, I’m someone who finds joy in coding (even when the bugs test my patience), hoards books like treasures, and swoons over timeless classics like they’re old friends.
</p>
<p>This little corner of the internet is my way of sharing the magic in everyday moments — the quiet ones, the quirky ones, and everything in between. If you're into heartfelt stories, a dash of humor, and maybe a Taylor Swift lyric or two slipped in for good measure, you're definitely in the right place.
</p>
<p>✨ Want to connect? Say hi? Talk about books or brainstorm ideas over coffee emojis?</p>
<h3 class="tag"> I’d love to hear from you!</h3>
